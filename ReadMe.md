## 🚧 Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter Here

Welcome to my digital dumpster. This repository is a collection of:

* 🧪 Half-baked experiments
* 🧠 3 AM ideas that seemed brilliant at the time
* 🍝 Spaghettoni (heavy spaghetti code)
* 🗑️ Scripts that I'm too afraid to delete but too ashamed to put in a real repo

## 📂 Directory Structure

There is none. Or maybe there is. It depends on my mood that day.

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

1.  **Don't.**
2.  If you really must, copy-paste at your own risk.
3.  If your computer explodes, I was never here.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* Whatever I was learning that week.
* StackOverflow copy-pastes.
* Pure willpower.

## 🐛 Contributing

If you see something here that you like, steal it. If you see something that breaks, don't fix it—it's part of the aesthetic.
